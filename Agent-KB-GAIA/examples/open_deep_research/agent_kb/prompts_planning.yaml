semantic_match_prompt: |
  Task : Determine if the semantic meaning of the prediction and true_answer matches.

  Input Format :
  question: [Description of the specific task]
  prediction: [Model generated output]
  true_answer: [Ground truth answer]

  Judgment Criteria :
  1. Semantic match takes precedence over literal match (allow synonyms/paraphrasing)
  2. Core information must be identical (entities/numbers/logical relationships must align)
  3. Ignore minor formatting differences (punctuation, spacing, capitalization)

  Consider false when:
  - Semantic contradictions exist
  - Information is missing/redundant
  - Precision mismatch (e.g., "2023" vs "May 2023")
  - Correct results caused by reasoning errors

  Output Requirements:
  - Strictly return plain text "true" or "false"
  - No explanations or additional content
  - Maintain strict boolean output format

  Examples:
  question: On the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016, what feature caused the largest bubble to be the size it is?
  prediction: citation count
  true_answer: citations
  true

  task: Calculate the result of 2+3
  prediction: five
  true_answer: 6
  false

  Now answer the task below:\n
  question: {{question}}
  prediction: {{prediction}}
  true_answer: {{true_answer}}

  Extract key information from user query to construct efficient search terms for retrieving the most relevant results.

  Requirements:
  1. Analyze the user's question to identify core concepts, terminology, and keywords
  2. Extract contextual information and constraints that may impact search quality
  3. Break down complex questions into searchable components
  4. Identify the domain, subject matter, and specific needs of the question

  Output format:
  <core concepts or topics of the question>

  Ensure search terms are specific enough to retrieve relevant information while maintaining sufficient breadth to capture related cases.
  Combine technical terminology with everyday expressions to optimize search effectiveness.

  Here is the user query:
