task_decomposition_prompt: |
    You have one question to answer. Break it down into sub-tasks(sub-queries) to reach the goal.
    You do not need to actually compute the answer; just outline the strategy.
    Here is the task:
    {{task}}

task_decomposition_with_examples_prompt: |
    You have one question to answer. Break it down into sub-tasks(sub-queries) to reach the goal.
    You do not need to actually compute the answer; just outline the strategy.
    Here is the task:
    {{task}}
    You must decompose the above task with reference to the similar task-decomposition rationales below.
    Here is the decomposition steps and rationale for each step:
    {{decomposed_with_rationale_examples}} 

subtask_planning_prompt: |
    You have to make a step-by-step plan. Do not skip any necessary steps, and do not add any unnecessary steps.
    Here is the final task:
    {{task}}
    Here are the sub-tasks(sub-queries) for the final task:
    {{sub_tasks}}
    Here is the sub-task(sub-query) that you have to plan now:
    {{curruent_sub_task}}

count_steps: |
  You are a component inside a Python program.

  Task:
  - Count how many steps are in the list below.

  IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES:
  - Output ONLY the number of steps.
  - Use ONLY digits 0-9.
  - Do NOT output any words, sentences, or explanations.
  - Do NOT output spaces, newlines, or punctuation.
  - Do NOT repeat these instructions.
  - Your ENTIRE reply will be passed directly into Python int(), so
    ANY extra characters will crash the program.
  - Your reply must match this regex exactly: ^[0-9]+$

  If there are no steps, output 0.

  Valid examples:
  - 3
  - 10
  Invalid examples:
  - "There are 3 steps"
  - 3 steps
  - 3\n

  Here are the steps:
  {{steps}}



extract_specific_step: |
    Extract the {{step_number}}-th step from the following plan.
    Here are the steps:
    {{steps}}

extract_step_list: |
  You are a function that extracts and summarizes procedure steps.

  <task>
  From the text in steps, find the main procedure steps and rewrite each step as a short, clear instruction.
  Here are the steps:
  {{steps}}
  </task>

  <output_format>
  You must return ALL steps as a JSON array of strings.
  Each string MUST be in the format: "Step N: ...".
  Do NOT output anything else. No explanations, no extra keys.
  The first element must start with "Step 1: ...".
  </output_format>
