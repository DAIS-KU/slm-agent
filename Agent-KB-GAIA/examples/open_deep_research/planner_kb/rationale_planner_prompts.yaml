task_decomposition_prompt: |
    You have one question to answer. Break it down into sub-tasks(sub-queries) to reach the goal.
    You do not need to actually compute the answer; just outline the strategy.
    Here is the task:
    {{task}}

task_decomposition_with_examples_prompt: |
    You have one question to answer. Break it down into sub-tasks(sub-queries) to reach the goal.
    You do not need to actually compute the answer; just outline the strategy.
    Here is the task:
    {{task}}
    You must decompose the above task with reference to the similar task-decomposition rationales below.
    Here is the decomposition steps and rationale for each step:
    {{decomposed_with_rationale_examples}} 

subtask_planning_prompt: |
    You have to make a step-by-step plan. Do not skip any necessary steps, and do not add any unnecessary steps.
    Here is the final task:
    {{task}}
    Here are the sub-tasks(sub-queries) for the final task:
    {{sub_tasks}}
    Here is the sub-task(sub-query) that you have to plan now:
    {{curruent_sub_task}}

extract_step_list: |
    You must return all steps as a JSON array of strings in the following format: ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ...", ...].
    Here are the steps:
