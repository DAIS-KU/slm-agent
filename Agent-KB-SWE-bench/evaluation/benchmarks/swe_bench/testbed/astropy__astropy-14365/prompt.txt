Objective: Modify the Astropy QDP table reader/writer code to fix failing test cases. Key issues to address include:

1. Table Block Segmentation
Problem: Tables are separated by NO rows, but the code may not split blocks correctly.
Fix: Split data blocks using NO lines and ensure table_id correctly indexes these blocks.
2. Error Column Handling (TERR/SERR)
Problem: Column indices for READ TERR and READ SERR are 1-based (QDP standard), but code may treat them as 0-based.
Fix:
For READ TERR X: The data column at index X has asymmetric errors in the next two columns (e.g., X=1 → data column 0, errors in columns 1 and 2).
For READ SERR Y: The data column at index Y has symmetric errors in the next column.
3. Handling NO and NaN Values
Problem: NO (missing data) and NaN values are not properly masked or converted during read/write.
Fix:
Read: Replace NO with masked values or NaN in MaskedColumn.
Write: Convert masked/NaN values back to NO.
4. Delimiter Support
Problem: Comma-separated QDP files (e.g., test_roundtrip_example_comma) fail due to incorrect delimiter handling.
Fix: Add sep parameter to _read_table_qdp and _write_table_qdp to handle both space and comma-delimited data.
5. Metadata Preservation
Problem: Initial comments (before READ commands) and table-specific comments (after !) are not stored in table.meta.
Fix: Capture comments in meta['initial_comments'] and meta['comments'] and regenerate them when writing.
6. Column Names Assignment
Problem: User-provided names parameter does not override default column names (e.g., MJD, Rate).
Fix: Use names to rename columns instead of appending suffixes.
7. Multiple Command Block Warning
Problem: Files with multiple READ commands (e.g., test_roundtrip) do not trigger AstropyUserWarning.
Fix: Detect repeated READ blocks and issue a warning.
Validation Criteria
Ensure all tests pass, with special attention to:

NaN/NO Roundtrips: Values should remain consistent after read → write → read.
Example: In test_roundtrip, NO in input → masked in table → NO in output.
Error Columns: Verify MJD_perr and MJD_nerr are correctly read (e.g., test_get_tables_from_qdp_file).
Metadata: Check meta['comments'] and meta['initial_comments'] are preserved.
Delimiters: Ensure comma-separated data (e.g., test_roundtrip_example_comma) is parsed correctly.
Code Modifications Needed:

Reader:
Split data into blocks using NO lines.
Map TERR/SERR columns correctly (1-based → 0-based indices).
Replace NO with masked values and handle NaN.
Capture comments in table.meta.
Writer:
Convert masked/NaN values to NO.
Rebuild comments from meta.
Support customizable delimiters.
Test Focus:

test_roundtrip: NaN/NO handling and metadata.
test_read_example: Error column alignment.
test_roundtrip_example_comma: Delimiter flexibility.
